		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Environment",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down Task 1 into subtasks such as: creating the folder structure, initializing a git repository, setting up uv package management specific to Python 3.8+, and drafting the README.md with installation instructions.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves setting up basic project infrastructure. While essential, it is straightforward and modular, making it low in complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Management Module",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into subtasks: 1) Create the config/settings.py with standardized parameters, 2) Integrate environment variable management for sensitive data, and 3) Implement tests to ensure configuration consistency across modules.",
			"reasoning": "This module mainly involves setting up a centralized configuration file and ensuring consistency. Its straightforward nature makes it lower complexity and suitable for a three-part breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Data Collection Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the task into: 1) Setting up yfinance API calls for data download, 2) Implementing error handling and rate limit management, 3) Creating logic to download data and save CSV files, and 4) Integrating logging for monitoring failures.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves external API integration with error management, data processing and logging, making it moderately complex and well-suited to an organized four-step breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Data Cleaning and Preprocessing",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task into subtasks: 1) Identify and handle missing values, 2) Filter out outliers, 3) Standardize date formats, and 4) Save the processed data with integrity checks.",
			"reasoning": "Data cleaning requires addressing different data quality issues. The four-step breakdown ensures each aspect is handled distinctly, making the task clear and manageable."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement PyPortfolioOpt Optimizer Module",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break the module into: 1) Loading preprocessed data, 2) Implementing mean-variance optimization logic, 3) Calculating the efficient frontier, and 4) Formatting and validating outputs in JSON/CSV.",
			"reasoning": "Although the optimization using PyPortfolioOpt involves some financial algorithms, the task can be neatly partitioned into four main steps, balancing both computational and formatting needs."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Riskfolio-Lib Optimizer Module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the module into: 1) Loading and verifying processed data, 2) Applying risk parity optimization with Riskfolio-Lib, 3) Standardizing the output format, and 4) Validating that weights follow risk parity principles.",
			"reasoning": "Riskfolio-Libâ€™s focus on risk parity adds some additional complexity, requiring careful data validation and output consistency. The four subtasks capture these key steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Eiten Optimizer Module",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this task into: 1) Extracting processed data, 2) Applying statistical methods using Eiten, 3) Normalizing and correctly allocating portfolio weights, and 4) Cross-verifying outputs with documented benchmarks.",
			"reasoning": "Since this module is similar to other optimizers but emphasizes statistical methods, a structured four-part breakdown addresses data extraction, processing, normalization, and verification."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Portfolio Comparison Engine",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Segment the engine into: 1) Reading portfolio data from results, 2) Calculating correlation and discrepancy metrics, 3) Generating visualizations with matplotlib, 4) Compiling CSV/JSON reports, and 5) Validating computed metrics with sample data.",
			"reasoning": "Combining data analysis with visualization and reporting increases the complexity. Five discrete subtasks ensure comprehensive coverage of data ingestion, computation, visualization, and validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Backtesting Analysis",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the integration into these stages: 1) Select and set up an appropriate backtesting framework, 2) Integrate the framework into a dedicated module, 3) Implement performance metric calculations, 4) Link optimizer outputs to the backtesting module, and 5) Verify the backtesting results against historical data.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating backtesting involves coordinating multiple components and ensuring accurate performance metrics, which makes it fairly complex and best handled through a five-part breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Final End-to-End Integration and Reporting",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the final integration into: 1) Developing a master orchestration script, 2) Integrating outputs into a unified report, 3) Implementing a command-line interface for user input, 4) Adding robust logging and error handling, 5) Creating a comprehensive end-to-end testing suite, and 6) Finalizing integration with updated documentation.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex as it requires seamless integration of all modules, extensive error handling, and detailed reporting. A six-part subdivision addresses orchestration, reporting, CLI, logging, testing, and documentation comprehensively."
