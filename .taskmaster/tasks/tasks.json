Key components include the VectorBTBacktester class, which handles portfolio simulation using VectorBT's Portfolio.from_orders() method. The module now seamlessly loads portfolio weights from JSON/CSV files generated by various optimizers and automatically imports price data from data/processed/. It calculates essential performance metrics such as returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown. Additional features include multi-format support, automatic normalization of portfolio weights, configurable risk-free rate, rebalancing frequency, and initial capital parameters, as well as comprehensive error handling and logging.
